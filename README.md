# sitelen seli kiwen
## handwritten sitelen pona font
### jan Lepeka

Years ago I created a handwritten font called Fluorine.<br>
It became very popular. It even appeared on greeting cards.<br>
A reddit user translated the Periodic Table into toki pona.<br>
They translated fluorine as “seli kiwen.”<br>
I became inspired to make a handwritten sitelen pona font.

The font comes in two versions:<br>
**sitelen seli kiwen asuki** automatically converts sitelen Lasina (Latin letters) into sitelen pona.<br>
**sitelen seli kiwen juniko** does not, requiring the use of [the UCSUR assignment for sitelen pona](http://www.kreativekorp.com/ucsur/charts/sitelen.html).

See [the HTML version of this page](https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/sitelenselikiwen/) to actually see the font.

### Compounds

In **asuki**, use `-` or `+` to combine words into compounds.<br>
Use `^` or `*` to explicitly specify a stacked or scaled compound, respectively.<br>
In **juniko**, use a zero-width joiner (U+200D) to combine words into compounds.<br>
Use U+F1995 or U+F1996 to specify a stacked or scaled compound, respectively.

[All compound glyphs from linja pona 3.6](http://musilili.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/LinjaPona3-6nimiAli.png) are supported, as well as a whole bunch of others.

### Extensions

In **asuki**, use `[` and `]` to make a cartouche.<br>
Use `(` and `)` to extend a glyph to the right.<br>
Use `{` and `}` to extend a glyph to the left.

In **juniko**, use U+F1990 and U+F1991 to make a cartouche.<br>
Use U+F1997 and U+F1998 to extend a glyph to the right.<br>
Use U+F199A and U+F199B to extend a glyph to the left.

### Variants

Enable OpenType character variants or stylistic sets to access variant glyphs.<br>
In **asuki**, some variants can be accessed by appending a number to a word.

### Special ZWJ Sequences

Some ZWJ sequences of three or more logographs<br>
or of a single logograph and a non-logograph character<br>
will produce characters that are not compound words<br>
(at least not by the usual rules of sitelen pona).

See [the HTML version of this page](https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/sitelenselikiwen/) to actually see all the glyphs.
